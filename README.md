## Overview

This project is a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the New York Airbnb 2024 dataset. The analysis leverages Python and several key data science libraries within a Jupyter Notebook environment to uncover insights into Airbnb listings across New York City. The primary goal is to provide a deeper understanding of listing characteristics, pricing trends, and host behaviors.

This project demonstrates proficiency in data manipulation, cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, all crucial skills for a data science role.

## Key Objectives

The EDA focuses on answering key questions such as:

* What is the distribution of Airbnb listing prices across different neighborhoods and boroughs?
* How do room types (e.g., private room, entire home/apt) influence pricing and availability?
* Are there any correlations between listing features (e.g., number of reviews, availability) and price?
* How is host activity (e.g., number of listings) distributed?

## Contents

The analysis is organized within the `EDA Python Project.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook and covers the following key topics:

* **Data Cleaning and Handling Missing Values:** Implementation of strategies to address missing data and ensure data quality for accurate analysis.
* **Summary Statistics & Correlation Heatmap:** Calculation of descriptive statistics and visualization of variable correlations to understand data distribution and relationships.
* **Visualizations with Histograms, Pairplots, and Bar Charts:** Creation of informative visualizations to explore data distributions, relationships between variables, and categorical breakdowns.
* **Neighbourhood & Price Analysis:** Detailed examination of pricing variations across different New York City neighborhoods and boroughs.
* **Room Type Distribution & Availability Insights:** Analysis of the prevalence of different room types and their impact on availability patterns.
* **Handling Outliers and Advanced Filtering:** Techniques used to identify and handle outliers, along with advanced filtering methods to analyze specific subsets of the data.

* **Jupyter Notebook:** Interactive environment for writing and running Python code.

## Key Skills Demonstrated

This project showcases the following skills relevant to data science positions:

* **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, inconsistent data, and outliers.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovering patterns, trends, and anomalies in data.
* **Data Visualization:** Creating compelling visualizations to communicate findings.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Applying descriptive and inferential statistics.
* **Domain Knowledge:** Understanding the context of Airbnb data.
* **Python Programming:** Proficiency in using key data science libraries.
* **Jupyter Notebooks:** Creating reproducible and well-documented analysis.

## Further Exploration

Potential extensions to this project include:
